       <li>1 cup oat flour (or finely ground oats)</li>
       <li>1 scoop vanilla protein powder (whey or plant-based)</li>

       <li>1/4 cup coconut oil, melted</li>
       <li>1/4 cup honey or maple syrup</li>
       <li>1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
       <li>1/3 cup mini dark chocolate chips (optional)</li>
       <li>1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional, e.g., almonds, walnuts)</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Directions</h1>

   <ol>
       <li>
            <strong>Preheat the Oven: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mix Dry Ingredients: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine almond flour, oat flour, protein powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Wet Ingredients: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the almond butter, melted coconut oil, honey or maple syrup, applesauce, 
                    and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a thick dough forms. If the dough is too dry, 
                    add a bit more applesauce or a splash of milk (dairy or non-dairy) until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add Mix-Ins: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fold in the mini dark chocolate chips and chopped nuts, if using.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Form the Cookies: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scoop out dough using a tablespoon or cookie scoop and place on the prepared baking sheet.
                    Flatten each scoop slightly with your fingers or the back of a spoon to form a cookie shape.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. 
                    The cookies will still be soft in the center but will firm up as they cool.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool and Enjoy: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

            <strong>Nutrition Information: </strong>These cookies are high in protein and healthy fats, making them a great option for a post-workout snack or a healthy treat. 
            Adjust the sweetness to your preference by varying the amount of honey or maple syrup used.
        </li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Note for Crunchy Cookies:</h1>

   <p>If you prefer your protein cookies to be crunchy rather than chewy, follow these tips:</p>

   <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Baking Time: </strong>Extend the baking time by 3-5 minutes. 
            Keep an eye on the cookies and remove them from the oven when they are a deep golden brown around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Omit Applesauce: </strong>Replace the applesauce with additional coconut oil or a bit more nut butter to reduce the moisture content.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use Less Moisture: </strong>Reduce the amount of honey or maple syrup slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool Completely: </strong>Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack. 
            This will help them set and become crispier.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage: </strong>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. 
            If you live in a humid climate, you might want to add a small packet of silica gel to the container to keep the cookies crisp.
        </li>
   </ul>

   <p>By following these adjustments, you can enjoy a delicious, crunchy version of these protein cookies!</p>
