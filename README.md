# Odin-Recipes
This is my first project after joining the full-stack development training community -- The Odin Project --

For this project I am in charge of creating a website where I will apply what I have learned after completing the HTML Foundations module
on The Odin Project (TOP). Some of the knowledge I have acquired include: how to add links, images, how to use elements and tags, defining headings and paragraphs, and creating ordered as well as unordered lists. 

The website is about recipes and will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few of my favorite dessert recipes. At the beginning of this project, the website will only be structured utilizing HTML. When further into the curriculum, I will also apply CSS code to showcase my skills and make the website look aesthetically pleasing.
